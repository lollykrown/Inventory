# Inventory

An android app that reads the content of an excel sheet in its asset folder. The read data is then written into an sqlite database. This was done using an old Jexcel api. The jar file can be found in the libs folder in this project.

[The Excel file used in this project is here](https://github.com/lollykrown/Inventory/Inventory/app/main/Assets/products.xls). It can also be found in the Assets folder in this project. Also. it has to be in .xls format
